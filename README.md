# pickle

A Sketch plugin for [pickle](https://pickle.run). Pickle lets you get quick feedback on anything you design. By integrating research early in your design process, you'll be more confident in your final designs.

How it works:
- Select up to 4 layers and ask people a question, like, "Which design do you like better?"
- Get responses within minutes, along with some basic demographic data.

## Installation

To install, [download the zip file](https://github.com/billychasen/pickle-sketch/releases/latest/download/pickle.sketchplugin.zip) and double-click on `pickle.sketchplugin`. Pickle will show up under `Plugins > New Question`.

## Usage

1. [Join](https://pickle.run/join) and add credits to your account. Each response is ten cents (100x less than other research sites).
2. Copy your apikey, which can be found [here](https://pickle.run/docs_api).
3. Select 2 or more layers (up to 4) that you'd like to ask a comparison question about.
4. Run the plugin and add your apikey, question, and number of people you'd like to ask.
5. Wait for results!
